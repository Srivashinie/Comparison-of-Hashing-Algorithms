# Comparison-of-Hashing-Algorithms

This repository contains a comparison of various hashing algorithms implemented in Python. The comparison was done as part of course CS 584 (Algorithms Design and Analysis) to analyze the performance, collision rates, and other characteristics of these algorithms. The repository includes a documentation of the outcomes and experiments conducted with the algorithms.
